We developed Farm-Buddy, a web-based application designed to help farmers make informed decisions based on real-time geospatial data. By integrating data from NASA and other space agencies, the platform provides crop recommendations based on weather, precipitation, soil moisture, and heat data. Additionally, it offers natural calamity alerts and guidance on how to adapt to climate adversities. This project addresses the challenge of unpredictable weather patterns and climate change, helping farmers optimize crop yields, minimize losses, and ensure sustainable farming practices. Its importance lies in empowering farmers, especially in regions vulnerable to climate change, with actionable insights to improve agricultural productivity.
